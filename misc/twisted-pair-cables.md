# Twisted Pair Cables Cheat-Sheet

## Cable Types

| Cable Type | Shielding | Description | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **UTP** | None | Twisted wires to reduce EMI and crosstalk | Most common and basic type of cable |
| **STP** | Foil wrapping or copper braid jacket | Twisted wires wrapped with shielding material | Reduces EMI and crosstalk more than UTP |
| **FTP** | Foil wrapping around each twisted pair | Each pair of wires wrapped in foil for added protection | Provides better shielding than UTP |
| **S/FTP** | Combines FTP and STP shielding | Twisted wires wrapped in foil, then wrapped in a shielding material | Provides highest level of protection against EMI and crosstalk |
